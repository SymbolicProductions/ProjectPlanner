PATCH NOTES

v1.4 Internal Release version.

- Create the finalized version of the frigging program,
it took about 4 days to learn visual studio and application
programming to get to this point. And I feel pretty tired since
I have been working nonstop, but I know that this program will
actually help me and hopefully others with their projects and maybe
even add a feeling of completion when they look at how many tickets
they have completed!

v1.5 Interal Release version, patch 01.

- Added a dialog box to remind the user that if they create a new project
they might lose unsaved data.

- Added multiple simple shortcuts for each form, using escape and enter to
navigate quicker should now be a complete feature.

- Timer for tickets and global timer are now displayed in hours:minutes:seconds.

- Fixed the issue of creating a subtask with no name.

- Fixed the saving issue of global timer, it now displays global time on loading save.

- Fixed the issue of finishing a ticket would cause either list of tickets to not display.

- Fixed the gruesome issue of when editing an item without rechoosing your category it 
would automaticly default to unassigned.

- Added the obvious shortcut that I forgot, CTRL + S to save project and CTRL + A to open.

- Updated documentation, removed the part about me. Did not like it.
